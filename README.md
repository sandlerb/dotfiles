# .dotfiles!

These are my dotfiles.

## Usage

script/bootstrap will install everything.  
Anything with a `.zsh` extension will be sourced.  
Anything with a `.symln_target` extension will be 
symlinked as `$HOME/.{file}`.

## Etc

### These are not my dotfiles
Much of this is from @holman's dotfiles and I also like to pinch a line or three from @peplin's dotfiles.  Some of the comments and base files are from zprezto.

### TODO
* symlink /etc/ zsh files
* clean up whitespace
* move zprezto stuff into dotfiles
* get rid of zprezto
* integrate mackup
* link to the dotfile repos mentioned above
* version control .vim folder
